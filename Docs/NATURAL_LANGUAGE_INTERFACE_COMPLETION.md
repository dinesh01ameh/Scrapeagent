## 💡 **Usage Examples**

### **Simple Queries**
```
"Get all products under $100"
"Find reviews with 4+ stars"
"Extract job listings with salary information"
```

### **Complex Conditional Logic**
```
"Get product prices, but if price is missing, check the description"
"Find reviews with 4+ stars, unless there are fewer than 10 reviews"
"First extract titles, then get prices, finally analyze distribution"
```

### **Multi-Step Conversations**
```
User: "I want to research gaming laptops"
System: "I'll break this into steps: 1) Find laptops, 2) Extract specs, 3) Compare ratings"
User: "Yes, but focus on laptops under $2000"
System: "Updated step 1 to include price filter. Proceed?"
```
